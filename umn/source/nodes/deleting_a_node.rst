Deleting a Node
===============

Scenario
--------

When a node in a CCE cluster is deleted, services running on the node will also be deleted. Exercise caution when performing this operation.

Notes and Constraints
---------------------

-  After a CCE cluster is deleted, the ECS nodes in the cluster are also deleted.

-

   .. important::

      For clusters of v1.17.11 or later, after a VM is deleted on the ECS console, the corresponding node in the CCE cluster is automatically deleted.

Precautions
-----------

-  Deleting a node will lead to pod migration, which may affect services. Perform this operation during off-peak hours.
-  Unexpected risks may occur during the operation. Back up related data in advance.
-  During the operation, the backend will set the node to the unschedulable state.
-  Only worker nodes can be deleted.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the CCE console and click the cluster name to access the cluster.
#. In the navigation pane, choose **Nodes**. In the same row as the node you will delete, choose **More** > **Delete**.
#. In the **Delete Node** dialog box, click **Yes**.

   .. note::

      -  After the node is deleted, pods on it are automatically migrated to other available nodes.
      -  If the disks and EIPs bound to the node are important resources, unbind them first. Otherwise, they will be deleted with the node.
