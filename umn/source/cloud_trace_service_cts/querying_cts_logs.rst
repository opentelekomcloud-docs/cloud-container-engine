Querying CTS Logs
=================

Scenario
--------

After you enable CTS, the system starts recording operations on CCE resources. Operation records of the last 7 days can be viewed on the CTS management console.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select a region.

#. Choose **Service List** from the main menu. Choose **Management & Deployment** > **Cloud Trace Service**.

#. In the navigation pane of the CTS console, choose **Cloud Trace Service** > **Trace List**.

#. On the **Trace List** page, query operation records based on the search criteria. Currently, the trace list supports trace query based on the combination of the following search criteria:

   -  **Trace Source**, **Resource Type**, and **Search By**

      Select the search criteria from the drop-down lists. Select **CCE** from the **Trace Source** drop-down list.

      If you select **Trace name** from the **Search By** drop-down list, specify the trace name.

      If you select **Resource ID** from the **Search By** drop-down list, select or enter a specific resource ID.

      If you select **Resource name** from the **Search By** drop-down list, select or enter a specific resource name.

   -  **Operator**: Select a specific operator (at user level rather than account level).

   -  **Trace Status**: Set this parameter to any of the following values: **All trace statuses**, **normal**, **warning**, and **incident**.

   -  Time range: You can query traces generated during any time range in the last seven days.
