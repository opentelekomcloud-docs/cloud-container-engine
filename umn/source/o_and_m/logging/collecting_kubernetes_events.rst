Collecting Kubernetes Events
============================

The Cloud Native Log Collection add-on works with LTS to collect and store Kubernetes events and works with AOM to generate alarms.

Reporting Kubernetes Events to LTS
----------------------------------

To enable Kubernetes event collection, take the following steps.

Logging Has Been Enabled for a Cluster
--------------------------------------

If logging has been enabled for a cluster but Kubernetes event collection has not been enabled, or the corresponding log collection policy has been deleted, you can manually create a log collection policy by taking the following steps:

#. Log in to the CCE console and click the cluster name to access the cluster console. In the navigation pane, choose **Logging**.

#. In the upper right corner, click **View Log Collection Policies**.

   All log collection policies are displayed.

#. Click **Create Log Collection Policy**. Then, select **Kubernetes events** and click **OK**.

#. (After the creation is complete, you can view logs on the **Logging** page.) Select the log stream configured in the log collection policy to view the events reported to LTS.

Reporting Kubernetes Events to AOM
----------------------------------

In 1.3.2 and later versions, the Cloud Native Log Collection add-on reports all warning events and some normal events to AOM by default. The reported events can be used to configure alarms. If the cluster version is 1.19.16, 1.21.11, 1.23.9, 1.25.4, or later, after the Cloud Native Log Collection add-on is installed, events will be reported to AOM by this add-on instead of the control plane component. After this add-on is uninstalled, events will not be reported to AOM.

**Custom Event Reporting**

If the reported events cannot meet requirements, you can modify the settings for the events.

Using kubectl
-------------

#. Run the following command on the cluster to modify the event collection settings:

   **kubectl edit logconfig -n kube-system default-event-aom**

#. Modify the event collection settings as required.
