Overview
========

Kubernetes logs allow you to locate and rectify faults. This section describes how to manage Kubernetes logs using different methods.

The following are Kubernetes log management methods:

-  Use the Cloud Native Log Collection add-on to collect application logs and report them to LTS, which provides log statistics and analysis. For details, see :ref:`Collecting Container Logs Using the Cloud Native Log Collection Add-on <cce_10_0555>`.
-  Connect CCE to AOM. For details, see :ref:`Collecting Container Logs Using ICAgent <cce_10_0018>`.
-  Collect control plane component logs and Kubernetes audit logs from the CCE control plane and add them to the LTS log streams in your account. For details, see :ref:`Collecting Control Plane Component Logs <cce_10_0554>` and :ref:`Collecting Audit Logs <cce_10_0792>`.
-  Collect Kubernetes events and add them to the LTS log stream in your account for persistent storage and statistical analysis. For details, see :ref:`Collecting Kubernetes Events <cce_10_0793>`.
