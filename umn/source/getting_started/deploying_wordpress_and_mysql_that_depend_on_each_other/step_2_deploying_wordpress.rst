Step 2: Deploying WordPress
===========================

WordPress was originally a blog platform based on PHP and MySQL. It is gradually evolved into a content management system. You can set up your own blog website on any server that supports PHP and MySQL. Thousands of plug-ins and countless theme templates are available for WordPress and easy to install.

This section describes how to create a public WordPress website from images.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  You have created a CCE cluster that contains a node with 4 vCPUs and 8 GiB memory. For details on how to create a cluster, see :ref:`Creating a Kubernetes Cluster <cce_qs_0008>`.
-  The MySQL database has been created by following the instructions in :ref:`Step 1: Deploying MySQL <cce_qs_0004>`. In this example, WordPress data is stored in the MySQL database.

Operations on the Console
-------------------------

#. Log in to the CCE console.

#. Click the name of the target cluster to access the cluster console.

#. In the navigation pane, choose **Workloads**. In the right pane, click **Create Workload** in the upper right corner.

#. Configure parameters as promoted.

   **Basic Info**

   -  **Workload Type**: Select **Deployment**.
   -  **Workload Name**: Enter **wordpress** in the text box.
   -  **Namespace**: Select **default**.
   -  **Pods**: Set this parameter to **2** in this example.

   **Container Settings**

   Enter **wordpress:php7.3** in the **Image Name** text box.

   Add environment variables.

   WordPress will get the information about the MySQL database with the following variables.

   -  **WORDPRESS_DB_HOST**: address for accessing the database, which can be found in the Service (on the **Services** tab page) of the MySQL workload. You can use the internal domain name **mysql.default.svc.cluster.local:3306** to access the database, or use only **mysql:3306** omitting **.default.svc.cluster.local**.
   -  **WORDPRESS_DB_USER**: username for accessing the database. The value must be the same as that of **MYSQL_USER** in :ref:`Step 1: Deploying MySQL <cce_qs_0004>`, which is used to access MySQL.
   -  **WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD**: password for accessing the database. The value must be the same as that of **MYSQL_PASSWORD** in :ref:`Step 1: Deploying MySQL <cce_qs_0004>`.
   -  **WORDPRESS_DB_NAME**: name of the database to be accessed. The value must be the same as that of **MYSQL_DATABASE** in :ref:`Step 1: Deploying MySQL <cce_qs_0004>`.

   **Service Settings**

   Click the plus sign (+) to create a Service for accessing the workload from an external network. This example shows how to create a LoadBalancer. Configure the following parameters in the window that slides out from the right:

   -  **Service Name**: name of the Service exposed to external networks. In this example, the Service name is **wordpress**.
   -  **Service Type**: Select **LoadBalancer**.
   -  **Service Affinity**: Retain the default value.
   -  **Load Balancer**: If a load balancer is available, select the existing load balancer. If not, click **Create Load Balancer** to create one on the ELB console.
   -  **Ports**:

      -  **Protocol**: Select **TCP**.
      -  **Service Port**: Set this parameter to **80**, which is mapped to the container port.
      -  **Container Port**: port on which the application listens. For containers created using the wordpress image, set this parameter to **80**. For other applications, set this parameter to the port of the application.

#. Click **Create Workload**.

   Wait until the workload is created.

   The created Deployment will be displayed on the **Deployments** tab.

Accessing WordPress
-------------------

#. Obtain the external access address of WordPress.

   Click the wordpress workload name to enter its details page. On the page displayed, click the **Access Mode** tab, view the IP address of WordPress. The public IP address is the external access address.

#. Enter the external access address in the address box of a browser to access WordPress.

   The following figure shows the accessed WordPress page.

Deleting Resources
------------------

Until now, you have completed all the Getting Started walkthroughs and have understood how to use CCE. If you will continue the CCE walkthroughs, retain the cluster. If the cluster used in the walkthroughs is no longer in use, take the following steps to delete them:

#. Log in to the CCE console.
#. In the navigation pane, choose **Clusters**.
#. Click |image1| next to the cluster to be deleted, select **Delete Cluster**, and confirm the information as prompted.
