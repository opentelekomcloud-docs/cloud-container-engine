Managing Workloads
==================

Scenario
--------

After a workload is created, you can upgrade, log, monitor, roll back, or delete the workload, as well as edit its YAML file.

Monitoring a Workload
---------------------

You can view the CPU and memory usage of Deployments and pods on the CCE console to determine the resource specifications you may need. This section uses a Deployment as an example to describe how to monitor a workload.

#. Log in to the CCE console, go to an existing cluster, and choose **Workloads** in the navigation pane.
#. Click the **Deployments** tab and click **Monitor** of the target workload. On the page that is displayed, you can view CPU usage and memory usage of the workload.
#. Click the workload name. On the **Pods** tab page, click the **Monitor** of the target pod to view its CPU and memory usage.

.. _cce_10_0007__en-us_topic_0107283638_section51511928173817:

Viewing Logs
------------

You can view logs of Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, and jobs. This section uses a Deployment as an example to describe how to view logs.

.. important::

   Before viewing logs, ensure that the time of the browser is the same as that on the backend server.

#. Log in to the CCE console, go to an existing cluster, and choose **Workloads** in the navigation pane.

#. Click the **Deployments** tab and click **View Log** of the target workload.

   In the displayed **View Log** window, you can view logs.

   .. note::

      The displayed logs are standard output logs of containers and do not have persistence and advanced O&M capabilities. To use more comprehensive log capabilities, see :ref:`Logs <cce_10_0553>`. If the function of collecting standard output is enabled for the workload (enabled by default), you can go to AOM to view more workload logs. For details, see :ref:`Collecting Container Logs Using ICAgent <cce_10_0018>`.

.. _cce_10_0007__en-us_topic_0107283638_section17604174417381:

Upgrading a Workload
--------------------

You quickly upgrade Deployments, StatefulSets, and DaemonSets on the CCE console.

This section uses a Deployment as an example to describe how to upgrade a workload.

Before replacing an image or image version, upload the new image to the SWR service.

#. Log in to the CCE console, go to an existing cluster, and choose **Workloads** in the navigation pane.
#. Click the **Deployments** tab and click **Upgrade** of the target workload.

   .. note::

      -  Workloads cannot be upgraded in batches.
      -  Before performing an in-place StatefulSet upgrade, you must manually delete old pods. Otherwise, the upgrade status is always displayed as **Processing**.

#. Upgrade the workload based on service requirements. The method for setting parameter is the same as that for creating a workload.
#. After the update is complete, click **Upgrade Workload**, manually confirm the YAML file, and submit the upgrade.

.. _cce_10_0007__en-us_topic_0107283638_section21669213390:

Editing a YAML file
-------------------

You can modify and download YAML files of Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, CronJobs, and pods on the CCE console. YAML files of jobs can only be viewed, copied, and downloaded. This section uses a Deployment as an example to describe how to edit the YAML file.

#. Log in to the CCE console, go to an existing cluster, and choose **Workloads** in the navigation pane.
#. Click the **Deployments** tab and choose **More** > **Edit YAML** in the **Operation** column of the target workload. In the dialog box that is displayed, modify the YAML file.
#. Click **OK**.
#. (Optional) In the **Edit YAML** window, click **Download** to download the YAML file.

.. _cce_10_0007__en-us_topic_0107283638_section13324541124815:

Rolling Back a Workload (Available Only for Deployments)
--------------------------------------------------------

CCE records the release history of all Deployments. You can roll back a Deployment to a specified version.

#. Log in to the CCE console, go to an existing cluster, and choose **Workloads** in the navigation pane.
#. Click the **Deployments** tab and choose **More > Roll Back** in the **Operation** column of the target workload.
#. Switch to the **Change History** tab page, click **Roll Back to This Version** of the target version, manually confirm the YAML file, and click **OK**.

.. _cce_10_0007__section132451237607:

Redeploying a Workload
----------------------

After you redeploy a workload, all pods in the workload will be restarted. This section uses Deployments as an example to illustrate how to redeploy a workload.

#. Log in to the CCE console, go to an existing cluster, and choose **Workloads** in the navigation pane.
#. Click the **Deployments** tab and choose **More** > **Redeploy** in the **Operation** column of the target workload.
#. In the dialog box that is displayed, click **Yes** to redeploy the workload.

.. _cce_10_0007__en-us_topic_0107283638_section12087915401:

Disabling/Enabling Upgrade (Available Only for Deployments)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Only Deployments support this operation.

-  After the upgrade is disabled, the upgrade command can be delivered but will not be applied to the pods.

   If you are performing a rolling upgrade, the rolling upgrade stops after the disabling upgrade command is delivered. In this case, the new and old pods co-exist.

-  After the upgrade is enabled, a Deployment can be upgraded or rolled back. Its pods will inherit the latest updates of the Deployment. If they are inconsistent, the pods will be upgraded automatically according to the latest information of the Deployment.

.. important::

   Deployments in the disable upgrade state cannot be rolled back.

#. Log in to the CCE console, go to an existing cluster, and choose **Workloads** in the navigation pane.
#. Click the **Deployments** tab and choose **More** > **Disable/Enable Upgrade** in the **Operation** column of the workload.
#. In the dialog box that is displayed, click **Yes**.

.. _cce_10_0007__en-us_topic_0107283638_section5931193015488:

Managing Labels
---------------

Labels are key-value pairs and can be attached to workloads. You can manage and select workloads by labels. You can add labels to multiple workloads or a specified workload.

#. Log in to the CCE console, go to an existing cluster, and choose **Workloads** in the navigation pane.
#. Click the **Deployments** tab and choose **More** > **Manage Label** in the **Operation** column of the target workload.
#. Click |image1|, enter a key and a value, and click **OK**.

   .. note::

      A key-value pair must contain 1 to 63 characters starting and ending with a letter or digit. Only letters, digits, hyphens (-), underscores (_), and periods (.) are allowed.

.. _cce_10_0007__en-us_topic_0107283638_section14423721191418:

Deleting a Workload/Job
-----------------------

You can delete a workload or job that is no longer needed. Deleted workloads or jobs cannot be recovered. This section uses a Deployment as an example to describe how to delete a workload.

#. Log in to the CCE console, go to an existing cluster, and choose **Workloads** in the navigation pane.

#. In the same row as the workload you will delete, choose **Operation** > **More** > **Delete**.

   Read the system prompts carefully. A workload cannot be recovered after it is deleted. Exercise caution when performing this operation.

#. Click **Yes**.

   .. note::

      -  If the node where the pod is located is unavailable or shut down and the workload cannot be deleted, you can forcibly delete the pod from the pod list on the workload details page.
      -  Ensure that the storage volumes to be deleted are not used by other workloads. If these volumes are imported or have snapshots, you can only unbind them.

.. _cce_10_0007__en-us_topic_0107283638_section1947616516301:

Events
------

This section uses a Deployment as an example to describe how to view events of a workload. To view the event of a job or CronJob, click **View Event** in the **Operation** column of the target workload.

#. Log in to the CCE console, go to an existing cluster, and choose **Workloads** in the navigation pane.
#. On the **Deployments** tab page, click the target workload. In the **Pods** tab page, click the **View Events** to view the event name, event type, number of occurrences, Kubernetes event, first occurrence time, and last occurrence time.

   .. note::

      Event data will be retained for one hour and then automatically deleted.
