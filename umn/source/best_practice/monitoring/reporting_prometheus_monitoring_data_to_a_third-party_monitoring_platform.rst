Reporting Prometheus Monitoring Data to a Third-Party Monitoring Platform
=========================================================================

Application Scenarios
---------------------

The Cloud Native Cluster Monitoring add-on can report Prometheus metrics collected from clusters to a specified platform, for example, AOM or a third-party platform that supports Prometheus metrics. This section explains how to configure settings for Cloud Native Cluster Monitoring to send collected metrics to a third-party's Prometheus instance.

.. _cce_bestpractice_10021__section9176195714457:

Step 1: Obtain the Data Reporting Address
-----------------------------------------

Prometheus provides standard Remote Write APIs. You can enter the source address (Remote Write URL) in the Cloud Native Cluster Monitoring add-on for storing the locally collected monitoring data in a Prometheus instance remotely.

-  If the Prometheus instance for receiving data is provided by a third-party vendor, view the Remote Write URL on the vendor's console.
-  If the Prometheus instance for receiving data is an on-premises one, the Remote Write URL is **https://** *{prometheus_addr}* **/api/v1/write**, where *{prometheus_addr}* indicates the IP address and port number for external access.

Step 2: Obtain the Authentication Mode
--------------------------------------

-  For the third-party Prometheus instance, go to the vendor's console to view the token or account password used for authorized access.
-  For the on-premises Prometheus instance, perform the following steps to obtain a token:

   #. If this Prometheus instance is deployed in a Kubernetes cluster, view the token in the corresponding container. If this Prometheus instance is deployed on a VM, skip this step.

      .. code-block::

         kubectl exec -ti -n monitoring prometheus-server-0 -- sh

      Replace the variables in the command as needed:

      -  *monitoring*: indicates the namespace where a Prometheus pod is in.
      -  *prometheus-server-0*: indicates the name of a Prometheus pod.

   #. Check the location of the configuration file.

      .. code-block::

         ps -aux | grep prometheus

      Information similar to the following is displayed:

      |image1|

   #. View and record the token information in **prometheus.env.yaml**.

      .. code-block::

         cat /etc/prometheus/config_out/prometheus.env.yaml

      |image2|

Step 3: Connect to a Third-Party Monitoring Platform
----------------------------------------------------

#. Log in to the CCE console, click the name of a cluster with the Cloud Native Cluster Monitoring add-on installed to access the cluster console.
#. In the navigation pane, choose **Add-ons**, locate the Cloud Native Cluster Monitoring add-on, and click **Edit**.
#. Enable **Report Monitoring Data to a Third-Party Platform** so that the data collected by Cloud Native Cluster Monitoring can be reported to a third-party monitoring platform.

   -  **Source Address**: Remote Write URL obtained in :ref:`step 1 <cce_bestpractice_10021__section9176195714457>`, for example, **https://127.0.0.1:9090/api/v1/write**.
   -  **Authentication method**: Select the authentication method supported by the third-party monitoring platform in :ref:`step 2 <cce_bestpractice_10021__section256205224014>`.

      -  **Basic Auth**: Enter the user name and password.
      -  **Bearer Token**: Enter the identity credential (token).

#. After the modification is complete, click **OK**.

Step 4: Check the Data Sending and Receiving Statuses
-----------------------------------------------------

After the preceding configuration is complete, log in to the Prometheus console supported by the third-party platform and view the Prometheus metrics with remote write on the **Graph** page.
