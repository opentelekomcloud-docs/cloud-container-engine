Upgrading the CoreDNS in the Cluster Timely
===========================================

CoreDNS provides simple functions and is compatible with different Kubernetes versions. CCE periodically synchronizes bugs from the community and upgrades the coredns add-on. You are advised to periodically upgrade the CoreDNS. The CCE add-on management center supports the CoreDNS installation and upgrade. You can define the CoreDNS version in the cluster. If the version can be upgraded, upgrade the CoreDNS component in the cluster as soon as possible.

You can upgrade CoreDNS in a cluster by performing the following procedure:

#. Log in to the CCE console and click the name of the target cluster to access the cluster console. In the navigation pane, choose **Add-ons**.
#. Locate the CoreDNS add-on and click **Upgrade**.
#. Set parameters.
