Containerization Process
========================

To fully containerize an application, you must go through the entire process.

This involves analyzing the application, setting up the runtime environment for the application, compiling the startup script and Dockerfile, creating and uploading images, and creating containerized workloads.

For details about each step of the containerization, see :ref:`Figure 1 <cce_bestpractice_0004__fig101821045193212>`.
