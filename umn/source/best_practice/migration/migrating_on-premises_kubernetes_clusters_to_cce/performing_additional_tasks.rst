Performing Additional Tasks
===========================

Verifying Application Functions
-------------------------------

Cluster migration involves full migration of application data, which may cause intra-application adaptation problems. In this example, after the cluster is migrated, the redirection link of the article published in WordPress is still the original domain name. If you click the article title, you will be redirected to the application in the source cluster. Therefore, search for the original domain name in WordPress and replace it with the new domain name, change the values of **site_url** and primary URL in the database. For details, see `Changing The Site URL <https://wordpress.org/support/article/changing-the-site-url/>`__.

Access the new address of the WordPress application. If the article published before the migration is displayed, the data of the persistent volume is successfully restored.
