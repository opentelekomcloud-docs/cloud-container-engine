Dynamic Resource Oversubscription
=================================

Many services see surges in traffic. To ensure performance and stability, resources are often requested at the maximum needed. However, the surges may ebb very shortly and resources, if not released, are wasted in non-peak hours. Especially for online jobs that request a large quantity of resources to ensure SLA, resource utilization can be as low as it gets.

Resource oversubscription is the process of making use of idle requested resources. Oversubscribed resources are suitable for deploying offline jobs, which focus on throughput but have low SLA requirements and can tolerate certain failures.

Hybrid deployment of online and offline jobs in a cluster can better utilize cluster resources.

Features
--------

.. note::

   After dynamic resource oversubscription and elastic scaling are enabled in a node pool, oversubscribed resources change rapidly because the resource usage of high-priority applications changes in real time. To prevent frequent node scale-ins and scale-outs, do not consider oversubscribed resources when evaluating node scale-ins.

Hybrid deployment is supported, and CPU and memory resources can be oversubscribed. The key features are as follows:

-  Offline jobs preferentially run on oversubscribed nodes.

   If both oversubscribed and non-oversubscribed nodes exist, the former will score higher than the latter and offline jobs are preferentially scheduled to oversubscribed nodes.

-  Online jobs can use only non-oversubscribed resources if scheduled to an oversubscribed node.

   Offline jobs can use both oversubscribed and non-oversubscribed resources of an oversubscribed node.

-  In the same scheduling period, online jobs take precedence over offline jobs.

   If both online and offline jobs exist, online jobs are scheduled first. When the node resource usage exceeds the upper limit and the node requests exceed 100%, offline jobs will be evicted.

-  CPU/Memory resources can be isolation by kernel.

   CPU isolation: Online jobs can quickly preempt CPU resources of offline jobs and suppress the CPU usage of the offline jobs.

   Memory isolation: When system memory resources are used up and OOM Kill is triggered, the kernel evicts offline jobs first.

-  kubelet offline jobs obey the following admission rules:

   After the pod is scheduled to a node, kubelet starts the pod only when the node resources can meet the pod request (predicateAdmitHandler.Admit). kubelet starts the pod when both of the following conditions are met:

   -  The total request of pods to be started and online running jobs < allocatable nodes
   -  The total request of pods to be started and online/offline running job < allocatable nodes+oversubscribed nodes

-  Resource oversubscription and hybrid deployment can be configured separately.

   Enabling hybrid deployment of a node pool also enables oversubscription by default. Nodes are then labeled with both **volcano.sh/colocation="true"** and **volcano.sh/oversubscription="true"**. To use hybrid deployment for both online and offline jobs without oversubscription, simply disable oversubscription in hybrid deployment settings. This will remove the **volcano.sh/oversubscription="true"** label.

   The following table lists the features that can be used after hybrid deployment or oversubscription is enabled.

   **Specifications**

   -  Cluster version

      -  v1.19: v1.19.16-r4 or later
      -  v1.21: v1.21.7-r0 or later
      -  v1.23: v1.23.5-r0 or later
      -  v1.25 or later

   -  Cluster type: CCE standard or Turbo
   -  Node OS: EulerOS 2.9 (kernel-4.18.0-147.5.1.6.h729.6.eulerosv2r9.x86_64) or HCE OS 2.0
   -  Node type: ECS
   -  Volcano version: 1.7.0 or later

   **Constraints**

   -  Before enabling oversubscription, ensure that the overcommit add-on is not enabled on Volcano.
   -  Modifying the label of an oversubscribed node does not affect the running pods.
   -  Running pods cannot be converted between online and offline services. To convert services, rebuild pods.
   -  If the label **volcano.sh/oversubscription=true** is configured for a node in the cluster, the **oversubscription** configuration must be added to the Volcano add-on. Otherwise, the scheduling of oversold nodes will be abnormal. Ensure that you have correctly configure labels because the scheduler does not check the add-on and node configurations. For details, see :ref:`Table 1 <cce_10_0384__table152481219311>`.
   -  To disable oversubscription, perform the following operations:

      -  Remove the **volcano.sh/oversubscription** label from the oversubscribed node.
      -  Set **over-subscription-resource** to **false**.
      -  Modify the configmap of Volcano Scheduler named **volcano-scheduler-configmap** and remove the oversubscription add-on.

   -  If you have set **cpu-manager-policy** to statically bind CPU cores on a node, do not assign the QoS class of Guaranteed to offline pods. This is because offline pods may occupy the CPUs of online pods, leading to an online pod startup failure and offline pods failing to start even though they have been successfully scheduled. To prevent this, switch the pods to online pods if CPU core binding is required.
   -  If **cpu-manager-policy** is set to static CPU core binding on a node, do not bind CPU cores to all online pods. This is because doing so can cause online pods to occupy all available CPU or memory resources, leaving only a small number of oversubscribed resources.

If the label **volcano.sh/oversubscription=true** is configured for a node in the cluster, the **oversubscription** configuration must be added to the Volcano add-on. Otherwise, the scheduling of oversold nodes will be abnormal. For details about the related configuration, see :ref:`Table 1 <cce_10_0384__table152481219311>`.

Ensure that you have correctly configure labels because the scheduler does not check the add-on and node configurations.

#. Enable node oversubscription.

   A label can be configured to use oversubscribed resources only after the oversubscription feature is enabled for a node. Related nodes can be created only in a node pool. To enable the oversubscription feature, perform the following steps:

   a. Create a node pool.
   b. Choose **Manage** in the **Operation** column of the created node pool.
   c. On the **Manage Components** page, enable **Node oversubscription feature (over-subscription-resource)** and click **OK**.

#. Set the node oversubscription label.

   The **volcano.sh/oversubscription** label needs to be configured for an oversubscribed node. If this label is set for a node and the value is **true**, the node is an oversubscribed node. Otherwise, the node is not an oversubscribed node.

   .. code-block::

      kubectl label node 192.168.0.0 volcano.sh/oversubscription=true

   An oversubscribed node also supports the oversubscription thresholds, as listed in :ref:`Table 2 <cce_10_0384__table1853397191112>`. For example:

   .. code-block::

      kubectl annotate node 192.168.0.0 volcano.sh/evicting-cpu-high-watermark=70

#. Deploy online and offline jobs and configure PriorityClasses for these jobs.

   The **volcano.sh/qos-level** annotation needs to be added to distinguish offline jobs. The value is an integer ranging from -7 to 7. If the value is less than 0, the job is an offline job. If the value is greater than or equal to 0, the job is an online job. You do not need to set this annotation for online jobs. For both online and offline jobs, set **schedulerName** to **volcano** to enable Volcano.

   .. note::

      The priorities between online jobs and between offline jobs are not differentiated, and the value validity is not verified. If the value of **volcano.sh/qos-level** of an offline job is not a negative integer ranging from -7 to 0, the job is processed as an online job.

   For an offline job:

Deployment Example
------------------

The following uses an example to describe how to deploy online and offline jobs in hybrid mode.

#. Configure a cluster with two nodes, one oversubscribed and the other non-oversubscribed.

   .. code-block::

      # kubectl get node
      NAME           STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
      192.168.0.173   Ready    <none>   4h58m   v1.19.16-r2-CCE22.5.1
      192.168.0.3     Ready    <none>   148m    v1.19.16-r2-CCE22.5.1

   -  192.168.0.173 is an oversubscribed node (with the **volcano.sh/oversubscription=true** label).
   -  192.168.0.3 is a non-oversubscribed node (without the **volcano.sh/oversubscription=true** label).

   .. code-block::

      # kubectl describe node 192.168.0.173
      Name:               192.168.0.173
      Roles:              <none>
      Labels:             beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64
                          ...
                          volcano.sh/oversubscription=true

#. Submit offline job creation requests. If resources are sufficient, all offline jobs will be scheduled to the oversubscribed node.

   The offline job template is as follows:

   .. code-block::

      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      metadata:
        name: offline

Handling Suggestions
--------------------

-  After kubelet of the oversubscribed node is restarted, the resource view of Volcano Scheduler is not synchronized with that of kubelet. As a result, OutOfCPU occurs in some newly scheduled jobs, which is normal. After a period of time, Volcano Scheduler can properly schedule online and offline jobs.

-  After online and offline jobs are submitted, you are not advised to dynamically change the job type (adding or deleting annotation volcano.sh/qos-level: "-1") because the current kernel does not support the change of an offline job to an online job.

-  CCE collects the resource usage (CPU/memory) of all pods running on a node based on the status information in the cgroups system. The resource usage may be different from the monitored resource usage, for example, the resource statistics displayed by running the **top** command.

-  You can add oversubscribed resources (such as CPU and memory) at any time.

   You can reduce the oversubscribed resource types only when the resource allocation rate does not exceed 100%.

-  If an offline job is deployed on a node ahead of an online job and the online job cannot be scheduled due to insufficient resources, configure a higher priorityClass for the online job than that for the offline job.

-  If there are only online jobs on a node and the eviction threshold is reached, the offline jobs that are scheduled to the current node will be evicted soon. This is normal.
