NUMA Affinity Scheduling
========================

In non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture, a NUMA node is a fundamental component that includes a processor and local memory. These nodes are physically separate but interconnected through a high-speed bus to form a complete system. To boost system performance, NUMA nodes allow for quicker access to local memory. However, accessing memory across multiple NUMA nodes within a node can cause delays. To enhance memory access efficiency and overall performance, it is crucial to optimize task scheduling and memory allocation.

When working with high-performance computing (HPC), real-time applications, or memory-intensive workloads that require frequent communication between CPUs, accessing nodes across NUMA in a cloud native environment can lead to decreased system performance due to increased latency and overhead. Volcano's NUMA affinity scheduling resolves the issue by scheduling pods to the worker node that requires the least number of cross-NUMA nodes. This reduces data transmission overheads, optimizes resource utilization, and enhances overall system performance.

Pod Scheduling Process
----------------------

After a topology policy is configured for pods, Volcano predicts the nodes that match the policy. For details about how to configure a pod topology policy, see :ref:`Example of NUMA Affinity Scheduling <cce_10_0425__section20735201818553>`. The scheduling process is as follows:

#. Volcano filters nodes with the same policy based on the topology policy configured for pods. The topology policy provided by Volcano is the same as that provided by the `topology manager <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/topology-manager/>`__.
#. Among the nodes where the same policy applies, Volcano selects the nodes whose CPU topology meets the policy requirements for scheduling.

:ref:`Figure 1 <cce_10_0425__fig1216082014438>` shows the scheduling of a pod after a topology policy is configured.

-  When 9 CPU cores are requested by a pod and the **best-effort** topology policy is used, Volcano selects node 1 whose topology policy is also **best-effort**, and this policy allows the pod to be scheduled to multiple NUMA nodes. Therefore, the requested 9 CPU cores will be allocated to two NUMA nodes, and the pod can be scheduled to node 1.
-  When 11 CPU cores are requested by a pod and the **restricted** topology policy is used, Volcano selects nodes 2 and 3 whose topology policy is also **restricted**, and each node provides at least 11 CPU cores. However, the remaining CPU cores on node 2 or 3 are less than the requested. Therefore, the pod cannot be scheduled.
-  When 17 CPU cores are requested by a pod and the **restricted** topology policy is used, Volcano selects nodes 2 and 3 whose topology policy is also **restricted**, this policy allows the pod to be scheduled to multiple NUMA nodes, and the upper CPU limit of both the nodes is less than 17. Then, the pod can be scheduled to node 3.
-  When 17 CPU cores are requested by a pod and the **single-numa-node** topology policy is used, Volcano selects nodes whose topology policy is also **single-numa-node**. However, no node can provide a total of 17 CPU cores. Therefore, the pod cannot be scheduled.

   **Figure 1** Comparison of NUMA scheduling policies

Scheduling Priority
-------------------

A topology policy aims to schedule pods to the optimal node. In this example, each node is scored to sort out the optimal node.

Principle: Schedule pods to the worker nodes that require the fewest NUMA nodes.

The scoring formula is as follows:

score = weight x (100 - 100 x numaNodeNum/maxNumaNodeNum)

Parameters:

-  **weight**: the weight of NUMA Aware Plugin.
-  **numaNodeNum**: the number of NUMA nodes required for running the pod on worker nodes.
-  **maxNumaNodeNum**: the maximum number of NUMA nodes required for running the pod among all worker nodes.

For example, three nodes meet the CPU topology policy for a pod and the weight of NUMA Aware Plugin is set to **10**.

-  Node A: One NUMA node provides the CPU resources required by the pod (numaNodeNum = 1).
-  Node B: Two NUMA nodes provide the CPU resources required by the pod (numaNodeNum = 2).
-  Node C: Four NUMA nodes provide the CPU resources required by the pod (numaNodeNum = 4).

According to the preceding formula, **maxNumaNodeNum** is **4**.

-  score (Node A) = 10 x (100 - 100 x 1/4) = 750
-  score (Node B) = 10 x (100 - 100 x 2/4) = 500
-  score (Node C) = 10 x (100 - 100 x 4/4) = 0

Therefore, the optimal node is Node A.

Example of NUMA Affinity Scheduling
-----------------------------------

The following describes how to choose NUMA nodes for scheduling pods according to pod scheduling policies. For details, see :ref:`Pod Scheduling Process <cce_10_0425__section2430103110429>`.

-  **single-numa-node**: When pods are scheduled, nodes in the node pool with the **single-numa-node** topology management policy will be chosen, and a single NUMA node must provide the CPU cores. If none of the nodes in the pool meet these requirements, the pod cannot be scheduled.
-  **restricted**: When pods are scheduled, nodes in the node pool with the **restricted** topology management policy will be chosen, and a set of NUMA nodes on the same node must provide the CPU cores. If none of the nodes in the pool meet these requirements, the pod cannot be scheduled.
-  **best-effort**: When pods are scheduled, nodes in the node pool with the **best-effort** topology management policy will be chosen, and a single NUMA node needs to provide the CPU cores. If none of the nodes in the pool meet these requirements, the pod will be scheduled to the most suitable node.

#. Refer to the following examples for configuration.

   a. Example 1: Configure NUMA affinity for a Deployment.

      .. code-block::

         kind: Deployment
         apiVersion: apps/v1
         metadata:
           name: numa-tset
         spec:
           replicas: 1
           selector:
             matchLabels:
               app: numa-tset
           template:
             metadata:
               labels:
                 app: numa-tset
               annotations:
                 volcano.sh/numa-topology-policy: single-numa-node    # Configure the topology policy.
             spec:
               containers:
                 - name: container-1
                   image: nginx:alpine
                   resources:
                     requests:
                       cpu: 2           # The value must be an integer and must be the same as that in limits.
                       memory: 2048Mi
                     limits:
                       cpu: 2           # The value must be an integer and must be the same as that in requests.
                       memory: 2048Mi
               imagePullSecrets:
               - name: default-secret

   b. Example 2: Create a Volcano job and enable NUMA affinity for it.

      .. code-block::

         apiVersion: batch.volcano.sh/v1alpha1
         kind: Job
         metadata:
           name: vj-test
         spec:
           schedulerName: volcano
           minAvailable: 1
           tasks:
             - replicas: 1
               name: "test"
               topologyPolicy: best-effort   # set the topology policy for task
               template:
                 spec:
                   containers:
                     - image: alpine
                       command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep 1000"]
                       imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
                       name: running
                       resources:
                         limits:
                           cpu: 20
                           memory: "100Mi"
                   restartPolicy: OnFailure

#. Analyze NUMA scheduling.

   The following table shows example NUMA nodes.

   +-------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
   | Worker Node | Topology Manager Policy | Allocatable CPU Cores on NUMA Node 0 | Allocatable CPU Cores on NUMA Node 1 |
   +=============+=========================+======================================+======================================+
   | Node 1      | single-numa-node        | 16                                   | 16                                   |
   +-------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
   | Node 2      | best-effort             | 16                                   | 16                                   |
   +-------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
   | Node 3      | best-effort             | 20                                   | 20                                   |
   +-------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

   In the preceding examples,

   -  In example 1, 2 CPU cores are requested by a pod, and the **single-numa-node** topology policy is used. Therefore, the pod will be scheduled to node 1 with the same policy.
   -  In example 2, 20 CPU cores are requested by a pod, and the **best-effort** topology policy is used. The pod will be scheduled to node 3 because it can allocate all the requested 20 CPU cores onto one NUMA node, while node 2 can do so on two NUMA nodes.

Checking NUMA Node Usage
------------------------

Run the **lscpu** command to check the CPU usage of the current node.

.. code-block::

   # Check the CPU usage of the current node.
   lscpu
   ...
   CPU(s):              32
   NUMA node(s):        2
   NUMA node0 CPU(s):   0-15
   NUMA node1 CPU(s):   16-31

Then, check the NUMA node usage.

.. code-block::

   # Check the CPU allocation of the current node.
   cat /var/lib/kubelet/cpu_manager_state
   {"policyName":"static","defaultCpuSet":"0,10-15,25-31","entries":{"777870b5-c64f-42f5-9296-688b9dc212ba":{"container-1":"16-24"},"fb15e10a-b6a5-4aaa-8fcd-76c1aa64e6fd":{"container-1":"1-9"}},"checksum":318470969}

The preceding example shows that two containers are running on the node. One container uses CPU cores 1 to 9 of NUMA node 0, and the other container uses CPU cores 16 to 24 of NUMA node 1.

Common Issues
-------------

**Schedule pods failed.**

If Volcano is set as the scheduler and only NUMA is enabled without configuring CPU management during pod scheduling, job scheduling may fail. To fix this issue, do as follows:

-  Before using NUMA affinity scheduling, make sure that Volcano has been deployed and is running properly.
-  When using NUMA affinity scheduling:

   #. Set the CPU management policy (**cpu-manager-policy**) of the node pool to **static**.
   #. Correctly configure the topology management policy (**topology-manager-policy**) in the node pool.
   #. Configure a correct topology policy for pods to filter nodes with the same topology policy in the node pool. For details, see :ref:`Example of NUMA Affinity Scheduling <cce_10_0425__section20735201818553>`.
   #. Configure the Volcano scheduler to schedule application pods. For details, see :ref:`Scheduling Workloads <cce_10_0722>`. Make sure that the CPU requests for all containers within the pods are integers (measured in cores) and that the requests and limits are identical.
