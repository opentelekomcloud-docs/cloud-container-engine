Preventing Cluster Deletion
===========================

Unexpected deletion of clusters can occur in practice, especially when multiple users share an account and accidentally delete clusters that do not belong to them. To prevent this issue, you can protect critical clusters against unexpected deletion through the console or APIs.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the CCE console and click the cluster name to access the cluster console.
#. In the navigation pane, choose **Settings**.
#. On the **Dashboard** tab page, locate **Cluster Deletion Protection** in the **Cluster Settings** area and click **Enable**. After this function is enabled, you are not allowed to delete clusters on CCE.
