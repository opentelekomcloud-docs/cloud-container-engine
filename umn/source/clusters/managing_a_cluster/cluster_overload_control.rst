Cluster Overload Control
========================

Scenario
--------

If enabled, concurrent requests are dynamically controlled based on the resource pressure of master nodes to keep them and the cluster available.

Constraints
-----------

The cluster version must be 1.23 or later.

Enabling Overload Control
-------------------------

**Method 1: Enabling it when creating a cluster**

When creating a cluster of v1.23 or later, you can enable overload control during the cluster creation.

**Method 2: Enabling it in an existing cluster**

#. Log in to the CCE console and click the name of an existing cluster whose version is v1.23 or later.
#. On the **Overview** page, check the master node information. If overload control is not enabled, a message will be displayed. You can click **Enable** to enable the function.

Disabling Cluster Overload Control
----------------------------------

#. Log in to the CCE console and go to an existing cluster whose version is v1.23 or later.
#. In the navigation pane, choose\ **Settings**.
#. On the **Cluster Access Configuration** tab, set cluster overload control (**support-overload**) to **false**.
#. Click **OK**.
