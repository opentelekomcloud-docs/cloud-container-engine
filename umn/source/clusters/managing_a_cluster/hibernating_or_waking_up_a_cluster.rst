Hibernating or Waking Up a Cluster
==================================

Scenario
--------

If a cluster is not needed temporarily, hibernate it to reduce costs.

After a cluster is hibernated, resources such as workloads cannot be created or managed in the cluster.

Precautions
-----------

-  During cluster wakeup, the master node may fail to start due to insufficient resources, which leads to a cluster wakeup failure. In this case, wait for a while and try again.
-  After a cluster is woken up, it takes 3 to 5 minutes to initialize data. Deliver services after the cluster runs properly.

Hibernating a Cluster
---------------------

#. Log in to the CCE console. In the navigation pane, choose **Clusters**.
#. Locate the cluster to be hibernated, click **...** to view more operations on the cluster, and choose **Hibernate**.
#. In the dialog box displayed, check the precautions and click **Yes**. Wait until the cluster is hibernated.

Waking Up a Cluster
-------------------

#. Log in to the CCE console. In the navigation pane, choose **Clusters**.
#. Click **Wake Up** in the row of the target cluster.
#. When the cluster status changes from **Waking up** to **Running**, the cluster is woken up. It takes about 3 to 5 minutes to wake up the cluster.
