GPU Pod Rebuild Risks
=====================

Check Items
-----------

Check whether GPU service pods are rebuilt in a cluster when kubelet is restarted during the upgrade of the cluster.

Solution
--------

Upgrade the cluster when the impact on services is controllable (for example, during off-peak hours) to minimize the impact. If you need help, contact O&M personnel.
