Ingress and ELB Configuration Consistency
=========================================

Check Items
-----------

Check whether any modifications have been made to the listener, forwarding policy, forwarding rule, backend cloud server group, backend cloud server, or certificate configurations that were automatically generated by the ingress on the ELB console.

Any modifications made to the ELB will be overwritten during the upgrade process. Verify the configuration consistency before upgrading the cluster.

Solution
--------

Based on the diagnostic analysis logs, determine which configurations require correction. Typically, this issue occurs when different forwarding policies are configured for the listener associated with the target ingress. This causes a mismatch with the forwarding policies configured for the cluster ingress. To resolve this, either transfer the additional forwarding policies to a different listener or add them to the ingress.
