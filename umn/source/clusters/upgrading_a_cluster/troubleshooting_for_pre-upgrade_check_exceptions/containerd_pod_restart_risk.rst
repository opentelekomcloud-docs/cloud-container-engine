containerd Pod Restart Risk
===========================

Check Items
-----------

Check whether the service containers running on a node that uses containerd are restart when the node's containerd is upgraded.

Solutions
---------

Upgrade the cluster when the impact on services is controllable (for example, during off-peak hours) to minimize the impact. If you need help, contact O&M personnel.
