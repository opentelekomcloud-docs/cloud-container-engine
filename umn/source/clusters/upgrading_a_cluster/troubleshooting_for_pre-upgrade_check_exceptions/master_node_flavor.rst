Master Node Flavor
==================

Check Items
-----------

Check whether the flavor of the master nodes in the cluster is the same as the actual flavor of these nodes.

Solution
--------

Flavor inconsistency is typically due to a modification made on the master nodes. After the cluster is upgraded, the modification of the master nodes may be restored. If the impact of the restoration cannot be evaluated, contact O&M personnel.
