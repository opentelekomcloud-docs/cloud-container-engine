Node CPU Cores
==============

Check Items
-----------

Verify that the master nodes in your cluster have more than 2 CPU cores.

Solution
--------

The master nodes have only 2 CPU cores, which may lead to a cluster upgrade failure.

Contact technical support to expand the number of CPU cores to four or more.
