Upgrade Management
==================

Check Items
-----------

Check whether the target cluster is under upgrade management.

Solution
--------

CCE may temporarily restrict the cluster upgrade due to the following reasons:

-  The cluster is identified as the core production cluster.
-  Other O&M tasks are being or will be performed, for example, 3-AZ reconstruction on master nodes.

To resolve this issue, contact technical support.
