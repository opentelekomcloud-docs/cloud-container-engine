GPU Add-on
==========

Check Item
----------

The GPU add-on is involved in the upgrade, which may affect the GPU driver installation during the creation of a GPU node.

Solution
--------

The GPU add-on driver needs to be configured by yourself. Check the compatibility between the GPU add-on and the GPU driver. It is a good practice to verify the upgrade of the GPU driver to the target version in the test environment, configure the current GPU driver, and check whether the created GPU node can run properly.

Perform the following operations to check the upgrade of the GPU driver to the target version and current driver configuration of GPU add-on:

#. Log in to the CCE console and click the cluster name to access the cluster console. Choose **Add-ons** in the navigation pane to view the GPU add-on.

   .. note::

      **gpu-beta** is the same as **gpu-device-plugin**. **gpu-beta** is renamed **gpu-device-plugin** in versions later than 2.0.0.

#. Click **Upgrade** of the add-on to view the target version and driver configuration of the add-on.

#. Verify the upgrade of the GPU driver to the target version in the test environment, configure the current GPU driver, and check whether the created GPU node can run properly.

   If the GPU add-on and the GPU driver are incompatible, install the driver of a later version. If necessary, contact technical support.
