SSH Connectivity of Master Nodes
================================

Check Items
-----------

Check whether your master nodes can be accessed using SSH.

Solution
--------

There is a low probability that the SSH connectivity check fails due to network fluctuations. Perform the pre-upgrade check again.

If the check still fails, submit a service ticket to contact technical support.
