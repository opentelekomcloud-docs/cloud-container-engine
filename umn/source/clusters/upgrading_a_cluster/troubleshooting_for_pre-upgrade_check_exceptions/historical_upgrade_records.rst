Historical Upgrade Records
==========================

Check Items
-----------

Check the historical upgrade records of the cluster and confirm that the current version of the cluster meets the requirements for upgrading to the target version.

Solution
--------

Upgrading your cluster from an earlier version can be risky and may result in this issue. To avoid this, it is recommended that you migrate the cluster beforehand.

If you still want to proceed with the cluster upgrade, submit a service ticket to contact technical support for evaluation.
