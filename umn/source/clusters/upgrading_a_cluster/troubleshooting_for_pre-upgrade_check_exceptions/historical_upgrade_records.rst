Historical Upgrade Records
==========================

Check Items
-----------

Check whether the source version of the cluster is earlier than v1.11 and the target version is later than v1.23.

Solution
--------

If the source version of the cluster is earlier than v1.11, it is risky to upgrade the cluster to a version later than v1.23. In this case, contact technical support.
