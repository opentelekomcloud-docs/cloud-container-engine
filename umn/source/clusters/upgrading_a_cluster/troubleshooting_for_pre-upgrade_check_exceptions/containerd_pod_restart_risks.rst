containerd Pod Restart Risks
============================

Check Items
-----------

Check whether the service pods running on a containerd node are restarted when containerd is upgraded.

Solution
--------

Upgrade the cluster when the impact on services is controllable (for example, during off-peak hours) to minimize the impact. If you need help, contact O&M personnel.
