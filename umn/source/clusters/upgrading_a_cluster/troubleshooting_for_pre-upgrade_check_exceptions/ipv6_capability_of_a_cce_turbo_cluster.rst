IPv6 Capability of a CCE Turbo Cluster
======================================

Check Item
----------

If IPv6 is enabled for a CCE Turbo cluster, check whether the target cluster version supports IPv6.

Solution
--------

CCE Turbo clusters support IPv6 since v1.23. This feature is available in the following versions:

-  v1.23: 1.23.8-r0 or later
-  v1.25: 1.25.3-r0 or later
-  v1.25 or later

If IPv6 has been enabled in the cluster before the upgrade, the target cluster version must also support IPv6. Select a proper cluster version.
