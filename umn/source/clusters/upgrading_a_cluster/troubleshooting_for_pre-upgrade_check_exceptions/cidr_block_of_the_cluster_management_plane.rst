CIDR Block of the Cluster Management Plane
==========================================

Check Items
-----------

Check whether the CIDR block of the cluster management plane is the same as that configured on the backbone network.

Solution
--------

The CIDR block of the management plane has been modified in your region. As a result, the CIDR block of the management plane and that of the backbone network are inconsistent.

Submit a service ticket to contact technical support to modify the settings, and recheck the configurations.
