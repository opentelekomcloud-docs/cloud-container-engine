Service Check
=============

Check Items
-----------

After a cluster is upgraded, check whether its services are running properly.

Procedure

Different services have different verification mode. Select a suitable one and verify the service before and after the upgrade.

You can verify the service from the following aspects:

-  The service page is available.
-  No alarm or event is generated on the normal platform.
-  No error log is generated for key processes.
-  The API dialing test is normal.

Solution
--------

If your online services malfunction after the cluster upgrade, contact technical support.
