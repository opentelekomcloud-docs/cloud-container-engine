New Pod Check
=============

Check Items
-----------

-  Check whether pods can be created on the existing nodes after the cluster is upgraded.
-  Check whether pods can be created on new nodes after the cluster is upgraded.

Procedure
---------

After creating a node based on :ref:`New Node Check <cce_10_0565>`, create a DaemonSet workload to create pods on each node.

#. Log in to the CCE console and click the cluster name to access the cluster console.

#. In the navigation pane, choose **Workloads**. On the displayed page, click **Create Workload** or **Create from YAML** in the upper right corner. For details about how to create a DaemonSet, see :ref:`Creating a DaemonSet <cce_10_0216>`.

   It is a good practice to use the image for routine tests as the base image. You can deploy minimum pods for an application by referring to the following YAML file.

   .. note::

      In this test, a DaemonSet is deployed in the default namespace using YAML. It uses the **nginx:perl** base image and specifies a request of 10m vCPUs and 10 MiB of memory. The resource limits for this DaemonSet are set to 100m vCPUs and 50 MiB of memory.

   .. code-block::

      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: DaemonSet
      metadata:
        name: post-upgrade-check
        namespace: default
      spec:
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: post-upgrade-check
            version: v1
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app: post-upgrade-check
              version: v1
          spec:
            containers:
              - name: container-1
                image: nginx:perl
                imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
                resources:
                  requests:
                    cpu: 10m
                    memory: 10Mi
                  limits:
                    cpu: 100m
                    memory: 50Mi

#. After the workload is created, check whether the pods of the workload are running properly.

#. After the check is complete, choose **Workloads** in the navigation pane. On the displayed page, click the **DaemonSets** tab, locate the **post-upgrade-check** workload, and choose **More** > **Delete** in the **Operation** column to delete the test workload.

Solution
--------

If the pod cannot be created or the pod status is abnormal, contact technical support and specify whether the exception occurs on new nodes or existing nodes.
