CCE AI Suite (NVIDIA GPU)
=========================

Introduction
------------

The CCE AI Suite (NVIDIA GPU) add-on is a device management add-on that supports GPUs in containers. If GPU nodes are used in the cluster, this add-on must be installed.

Constraints
-----------

-  The driver to be downloaded must be a **.run** file.
-  Only NVIDIA Tesla drivers are supported, not GRID drivers.
-  When installing or reinstalling the add-on, ensure that the driver download address is correct and accessible. CCE does not verify the address validity.
-  The gpu-beta add-on only enables you to download the driver and execute the installation script. The add-on status only indicates that how the add-on is running, not whether the driver is successfully installed.
-  CCE does not guarantee the compatibility between the GPU driver version and the CDUA library version of your application. You need to check the compatibility by yourself.
-  If a GPU driver has been added to a custom OS image, CCE cannot ensure that the GPU driver is compatible with other GPU components such as the monitoring components used in CCE.

Installing the Add-on
---------------------

#. Log in to the CCE console and click the cluster name to access the cluster console. Choose **Add-ons** in the navigation pane, locate **CCE AI Suite (NVIDIA GPU)** on the right, and click **Install**.
#. On the **Install Add-on** page, configure the specifications.

      | Parameter                         | Description                                                                            |
      +===================================+========================================================================================+
      | Add-on Specifications             | Select **Default** or **Custom**.                                                      |

      |                                   | If you select **Custom**, you can adjust the container specifications as required.     |
      +-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

#. Configure the add-on parameters.

   -  **NVIDIA Driver**: Enter the link for downloading the NVIDIA driver. All GPU nodes in the cluster will use this driver.

      .. important::

         -  If the download link is a public network address, for example, **https://us.download.nvidia.com/tesla/470.103.01/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-470.103.01.run**, bind an EIP to each GPU node. For details about how to obtain the driver link, see :ref:`Obtaining the Driver Link from Public Network <cce_10_0141__section95451728192112>`.
         -  If the download link is an OBS URL, you do not need to bind an EIP to GPU nodes. For details about how to obtain the driver link, see :ref:`Obtaining the Driver Link from OBS <cce_10_0141__section14922133914508>`.
         -  Ensure that the NVIDIA driver version matches the GPU node.
         -  After the driver version is changed, restart the node for the change to take effect.

   -  **Driver Selection**: If you do not want all GPU nodes in a cluster to use the same driver, CCE allows you to install a different GPU driver for each node pool.

      .. note::

         -  The add-on installs the driver with the version specified by the node pool. The driver takes effect only for new pool nodes.
         -  After the driver version of new nodes is updated, restart the nodes for the update to take effect. The driver version cannot be updated for non-new nodes.

#. Click **Install**.

   .. note::

      Uninstalling the add-on will clear the GPU driver on the nodes. As a result, GPU pods newly scheduled to the nodes cannot run properly, but running GPU pods are not affected.

Verifying the Add-on
--------------------

After the add-on is installed, run the **nvidia-smi** command on the GPU node and the container that schedules GPU resources to verify the availability of the GPU device and driver.

-  GPU node:

   .. code-block::

      # If the add-on version is earlier than 2.0.0, run the following command:
      cd /opt/cloud/cce/nvidia/bin && ./nvidia-smi

      # If the add-on version is 2.0.0 or later and the driver installation path is changed, run the following command:
      cd /usr/local/nvidia/bin && ./nvidia-smi

-  Container:

   .. code-block::

      cd /usr/local/nvidia/bin && ./nvidia-smi

If GPU information is returned, the device is available and the add-on has been installed.

Obtaining the Driver Link from Public Network
---------------------------------------------

#. Log in to the CCE console.
#. Click **Create Node** and select the GPU node to be created in the **Specifications** area. The GPU card model of the node is displayed in the lower part of the page.

3. Visit https://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en.

4. Select the driver information on the **NVIDIA Driver Downloads** page, as shown in :ref:`Figure 1 <cce_10_0141__fig11696366517>`. **Operating System** must be **Linux 64-bit**.

      :alt: **Figure 1** Setting parameters

      **Figure 1** Setting parameters

5. After confirming the driver information, click **SEARCH**. A page is displayed, showing the driver information, as shown in :ref:`Figure 2 <cce_10_0141__fig7873421145213>`. Click **DOWNLOAD**.

6. Obtain the driver link in either of the following ways:

   -  Method 1: As shown in :ref:`Figure 3 <cce_10_0141__fig5901194614534>`, find *url=/tesla/470.103.01/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-470.103.01.run* in the browser address box. Then, supplement it to obtain the driver link https://us.download.nvidia.com/tesla/470.103.01/NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-470.103.01.run. By using this method, you must bind an EIP to each GPU node.

   -  Method 2: As shown in :ref:`Figure 3 <cce_10_0141__fig5901194614534>`, click **AGREE & DOWNLOAD** to download the driver. Then, upload the driver to OBS and record the OBS URL. By using this method, you do not need to bind an EIP to GPU nodes.

Obtaining the Driver Link from OBS
----------------------------------

#. Upload the driver to OBS and set the driver file to public read.

   .. note::

      When the node is restarted, the driver will be downloaded and installed again. Ensure that the OBS bucket link of the driver is valid.

#. In the bucket list, click a bucket name, and then the **Overview** page of the bucket is displayed.
#. In the navigation pane, choose **Objects**.
#. Select the name of the target object and copy the driver link on the object details page.
