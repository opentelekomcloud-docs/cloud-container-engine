Creating a Deployment Mounted with an OBS Volume
================================================

Scenario
--------

After an OBS volume is created or imported to CCE, you can mount the volume to a workload.

Prerequisites
-------------

You have created a CCE cluster and installed the CSI plug-in (:ref:`everest <cce_01_0066>`) in the cluster.

Notes and Constraints
---------------------

The following configuration example applies to clusters of Kubernetes 1.15 or later.

Procedure
---------

#. Use kubectl to connect to the cluster. For details, see :ref:`Connecting to a Cluster Using kubectl <cce_01_0107>`.

#. Run the following commands to configure the **obs-deployment-example.yaml** file, which is used to create a pod.

   **touch obs-deployment-example.yaml**

   **vi obs-deployment-example.yaml**

   Example of mounting an OBS volume to a Deployment (PVC-based, shared volume):

   .. code-block::

      apiVersion: apps/v1
      kind: Deployment
      metadata:
        name: obs-deployment-example                        # Workload name
        namespace: default
      spec:
        replicas: 1
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: obs-deployment-example
        template:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app: obs-deployment-example
          spec:
            containers:
            - image: nginx
              name: container-0
              volumeMounts:
              - mountPath: /tmp                       # Mount path
                name: pvc-obs-example
            restartPolicy: Always
            imagePullSecrets:
              - name: default-secret
            volumes:
            - name: pvc-obs-example
              persistentVolumeClaim:
                claimName: pvc-obs-auto-example       # PVC name

   .. note::

      **spec.template.spec.containers.volumeMounts.name** and **spec.template.spec.volumes.name** must be consistent because they have a mapping relationship.

#. Run the following command to create the workload:

   **kubectl create -f obs-deployment-example.yaml**
