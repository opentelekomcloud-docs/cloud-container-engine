Hybrid Cloud
============

Application Scenarios
---------------------

-  Multi-cloud deployment and disaster recovery

   Running apps in containers on different clouds can ensure high availability. When a cloud is down, other clouds respond and serve.

-  Traffic distribution and auto scaling

   Large organizations often span cloud facilities in different regions. They need to communicate and auto scale â€” start small and then scale as system load grows. CCE takes care of these for you, cutting the costs of maintaining facilities.

-  Migration to the cloud and local database hosting

   Industries like finance and security have a top concern on data protection. They want to run critical systems in local IDCs while moving others to the cloud. They also expect one unified dashboard to manage all systems.

-  Environment decoupling

   To ensure IP security, you can decouple development from production. Set up one on the cloud and the other in the local IDC.

Benefits
--------

Thanks to containers' environment-independent feature, CCE manages containers in a unified manner, and these containers can access each other on CCE. You can seamlessly migrate your apps and data on and off the cloud. This meets complex services' requirements for auto scaling, flexibility, security, and compliance. Additionally, resources in different cloud environments can be operated and maintained in a unified manner, providing easier resource scheduling and DR.

Advantages
----------

-  On-cloud DR

   Multicloud prevents systems from outages. When a cloud is faulty, CCE auto diverts traffic to other clouds to ensure service continuity.

-  Unified architecture and auto scaling

   Unified architecture on and off the cloud can flexibly implement auto scaling, smooth migration to cope with traffic peaks.

-  Decoupling and sharing

   CCE decouples data, environments, and compute capacity. Sensitive data vs general data. Development vs production. Compute-intensive services vs general services. Apps running on-premises can burst to the cloud. Your resources on and off the cloud can be better used.

-  Lower costs

   Cloud resource pools, backed by auto scaling, can respond to load spikes in time. Manual operations are no longer needed and you can save big.
