ELB Ingresses Routing to Multiple Services
==========================================

Ingresses can route to multiple backend Services based on different matching policies. The **spec** field in the YAML file is set as below. You can access **www.example.com/foo**, **www.example.com/bar**, and **foo.example.com/** to route to three different backend Services.

.. important::

   The URL registered in an ingress forwarding policy must be the same as the URL used to access the backend Service. Otherwise, a 404 error will be returned.
