How Do I Prevent Cluster Nodes from Being Exposed to Public Networks?
=====================================================================

**Question**

How do I prevent cluster nodes from being exposed to public networks?

**Solution**

-  If access to port 22 of a cluster node is not required, you can define a security group rule that disables access to port 22.
-  Do not bind an EIP to a cluster node unless necessary.
