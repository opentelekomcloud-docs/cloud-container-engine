What Is the Retry Mechanism When CCE Fails to Start a Pod?
==========================================================

CCE is a cloud container engine service built on native Kubernetes. It fully supports native Kubernetes versions, Kubernetes APIs, and kubectl.

In Kubernetes, the spec of a pod contains a **restartPolicy** field. The value of **restartPolicy** can be **Always**, **OnFailure**, or **Never**. The default value is **Always**.

-  **Always**: When a container fails, kubelet automatically restarts the container.
-  **OnFailure**: When a container stops running and the exit code is not **0** (indicating normal exit), kubelet automatically restarts the container.
-  **Never**: kubelet does not restart the container regardless of the container running status.

**restartPolicy** applies to all containers in a pod.

**restartPolicy** only refers to restarts of the containers by kubelet on the same node. When containers in a pod exit, kubelet restarts them with an exponential back-off delay (10s, 20s, 40s, â€¦), which is capped at five minutes. Once a container has been running for 10 minutes without any problems, kubelet resets the restart backoff timer for the container.

The settings of **restartPolicy** vary depending on the controller:

-  **Replication Controller (RC)** and **DaemonSet**: **restartPolicy** must be set to **Always** to ensure continuous running of the containers.
-  **Job**: **restartPolicy** must be set to **OnFailure** or **Never** to ensure that containers are not restarted after being executed.
