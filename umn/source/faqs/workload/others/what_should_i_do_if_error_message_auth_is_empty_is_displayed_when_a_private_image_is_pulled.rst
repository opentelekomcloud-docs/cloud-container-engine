What Should I Do If Error Message "Auth is empty" Is Displayed When a Private Image Is Pulled?
==============================================================================================

Symptom
-------

When you replace the image of a container in a created workload and use an uploaded image on the CCE console, an error message "Auth is empty, only accept X-Auth-Token or Authorization" is displayed when the uploaded image is pulled.

.. code-block::

   Failed to pull image "IP address:Port number /magicdoom/tidb-operator:latest": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon: Get https://IP address:Port number /v2/magicdoom/tidb-operator/manifests/latest: error parsing HTTP 400 response body: json: cannot unmarshal number into Go struct field Error.code of type errcode.ErrorCode: "{\"errors\":[{\"code\":400,\"message\":\"Auth is empty, only accept X-Auth-Token or Authorization.\"}]}"

Solution
--------

You can select a private image to create an application on the CCE console. In this case, CCE automatically carries the secret. This problem will not occur during the upgrade.

When you create a workload using an API, you can include the secret in Deployments to avoid this problem during the upgrade.

.. code-block::

   imagePullSecrets:
   - name: default-secret
