Which Resource Quotas Should I Pay Attention To When Using CCE?
===============================================================

CCE restricts **only the number of clusters**. However, when using CCE, you may also be using other cloud services, such as Elastic Cloud Server (ECS), Elastic Volume Service (EVS), Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Elastic Load Balance (ELB), and SoftWare Repository for Containers (SWR).

What Is Quota?
--------------

Quotas can limit the number or amount of resources available to users, such as the maximum number of ECS or EVS disks that can be created.

If the existing resource quota cannot meet your service requirements, you can apply for a higher quota.
