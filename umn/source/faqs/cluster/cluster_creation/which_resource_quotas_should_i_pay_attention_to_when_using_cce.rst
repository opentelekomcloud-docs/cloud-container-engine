Which Resource Quotas Should I Pay Attention To When Using CCE?
===============================================================

CCE restricts **only the number of clusters**. However, when using CCE, you may also be using other cloud services, such as Elastic Cloud Server (ECS), Elastic Volume Service (EVS), Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Elastic Load Balance (ELB), and SoftWare Repository for Containers (SWR).

What Is Quota?
--------------

Quotas are enforced for service resources on the platform to prevent unforeseen spikes in resource usage. Quotas can limit the quantity and capacity of resources available to users, such as the maximum number of ECSs or EVS disks that can be created.

If a quota cannot meet your needs, apply for a higher quota.
