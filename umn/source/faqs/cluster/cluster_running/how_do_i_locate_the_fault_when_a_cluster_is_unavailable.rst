How Do I Locate the Fault When a Cluster Is Unavailable?
========================================================

If a cluster is unavailable, perform the following operations to locate the fault.

Troubleshooting Process
-----------------------

The issues here are described in order of how likely they are to occur.

Check these causes one by one until you find the cause of the fault.

-  :ref:`Check Item 2: Whether There Are Residual Listeners and Backend Server Groups on the Load Balancer <cce_faq_00039__section1821659134014>`

If the fault persists, contact the customer service to help you locate the fault.

Check Item 1: Whether the Security Group Is Modified
----------------------------------------------------

#. Log in to the management console and choose **Service List** > **Networking** > **Virtual Private Cloud**. In the navigation pane, choose **Access Control** > **Security Groups** to find the security group of the master node in the cluster.

   The name of this security group is in the format of *Cluster name*-cce-**control**\ ``-``\ *ID*.

#. Click the security group. On the details page displayed, ensure that the security group rules of the master node are correct.

   For details, see :ref:`How Can I Configure a Security Group Rule in a Cluster? <cce_faq_00265>`

Check Item 2: Whether There Are Residual Listeners and Backend Server Groups on the Load Balancer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Reproducing the Problem**

A cluster exception occurs when a LoadBalancer Service is being created or deleted. After the fault is rectified, the Service is deleted successfully, but there are residual listeners and backend server groups.

#. Pre-create a CCE cluster. In the cluster, use the official Nginx image to create a workload, preset a load balancer, a Service, and an ingress.
#. Ensure that the cluster is running properly and the Nginx workload is stable.
#. Create and delete 10 LoadBalancer Services every 20 seconds.
#. Verify that an injection exception occurs in the cluster. For example, the etcd is unavailable or the cluster is hibernated.

**Possible Causes**

There are residual listeners and backend server groups on the load balancer.

**Solution**

Manually clear residual listeners and backend server groups.

#. Log in to the management console and choose **Networking** > **Elastic Load Balance** from the service list.
#. In the load balancer list, click the name of the target load balancer to go to the details page. On the **Listeners** tab, locate the target listener and delete it.
#. On the **Backend Server Groups** page, locate the target backend server group and delete it.
