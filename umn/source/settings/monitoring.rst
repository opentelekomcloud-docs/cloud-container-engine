Monitoring
==========

CCE monitors applications and resources and collects metrics and events to analyze application health status. You can choose **Settings** from the navigation pane, click the **Monitoring** tab, and change monitoring parameters on the console.

Log Configuration
-----------------

**Collection configuration**

**Send stdout Logs to AOM 1.0** (**No more evolution**): Logging in AOM 1.0 has not been improved, so you are advised to disable this function and use LTS logging instead.
