Updating an AS Configuration
============================

Auto Scaling (AS) enables elastic scaling of nodes in a node pool based on scaling policies. Without this function, you have to manually adjust the number of nodes in a node pool.

Constraints
-----------

To enable AS, the :ref:`CCE Cluster Autoscaler <cce_10_0154>` add-on must be installed in the target cluster.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the CCE console and click the cluster name to access the cluster console.

#. In the navigation pane, choose **Nodes**. On the **Node Pools** tab, locate the row containing the target node pool and click **Auto Scaling**.

   -  If the auto scaling add-on has not been installed, configure add-on parameters based on service requirements, click **Install**, and wait until the add-on is installed. For details about add-on configurations, see :ref:`CCE Cluster Autoscaler <cce_10_0154>`.
   -  If the auto scaling add-on has been installed, directly configure auto scaling policies.

#. Configure auto scaling policies.

   **AS Configuration**

   -  **Customized Rule**: Click **Add Rule**. In the dialog box displayed, configure parameters. You can add multiple node scaling policies, a maximum of one CPU usage-based rule, and one memory usage-based rule. The total number of rules cannot exceed 10.

      The following table lists custom rules.
